# vs-code-agents

Collection of VS Code agent role definitions used in the workspace `vs-code-agents`.

This repository contains a set of agent instruction files (`*.agent.md`) that define responsibilities, handoffs, and workflows for a multi-agent system.

All agent specification files live under the `vs-code-agents/` folder. For a conceptual overview of the workflow and guidance on when to use each agent, see [USING-AGENTS.md](USING-AGENTS.md).
